            <span class="fancy">Robo</span>Toucan is a Slack Bot that lets you use support tickets on Slack. This way, you don't need to leave your beloved channel to assist your users, if you don't feel like it.

            With RoboToucan you can easily check if you've received new tickets, change their status, or write a reply, and the ticket will instantly update itself on our site.

        Support requests shouldn't be handled through Slack's direct messages.
